# CellProfiler-Pipeline-Multichannel-Image-Pseudocoloring-and-Overlay-Generation
Automated CellProfiler pipeline for multichannel fluorescence image visualization. Loads 2–4 channel images, applies standardized pseudocolors and user-defined brightness/contrast, generates combined overlay JPGs, and handles consistent channel mapping (d0–d3, including NIR) across datasets.
